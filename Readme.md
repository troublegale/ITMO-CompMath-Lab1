## Lab 1: Linear Algebraic Equation System Solver
### Method: Regular Gauss

How to use:
- Launch main.py
- Follow the instructions

Input file requirements:
- First not empty line of the file has to contain just the size of the matrix (number of equations in the system)
- Right after the line with the size there has to be *\<size\>* lines with the matrix's coefficients
- No blank lines between previously mentioned lines are allowed

***Note:*** this program is able to solve systems with up to only 20 equations!
